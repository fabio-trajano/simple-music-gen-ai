# **AI Music Generator ðŸŽµ**

An AI-powered music generation tool that creates audio tracks from simple text descriptions. This project leverages Hugging Face's `MusicGen` model to transform your creative ideas into unique soundscapes.

## **Features**
- Generate music from descriptive text prompts (e.g., "futuristic classic music").
- Save the generated audio as `.wav` files.
- Interactive command-line interface for user-friendly input.

---

## **How It Works**
1. The user provides a descriptive text prompt (e.g., "upbeat electronic dance music").
2. The script uses Hugging Face's `facebook/musicgen-small` model to generate an audio track.
3. The output is saved as a `.wav` file.
